# devops-public
General scripts and declarative templates for network, server, and security infrastructure management

## Ansible
If you want to do devops, you need the appropriate toolsets.  Ansible is a versatile tool for automation.  Choose Ansible Community Edition, which requires very little other than Python packages.  Or opt for AWX Tower for something more fully featured with event-driven mechanisms.  Finally, there is Ansible Automation Platform for which you will need a subscription.
